## My process

- I Started with HTML setup & then worked myself down all my CSS starting with background color, font sizes and font families. I then went ahead and centered the div and the images aswell as making all the hover states.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I Learned a lot of things about displaying things inside of a box or div and centering them on to that. This did take a bit of time to fully understand but once understanding i quickly implemented that on to this challenge.
